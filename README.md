# ActivityBuddies

##Final Group Project

Have fun. Cement the stack. Master full stack development. One week. That's what I'm going to tell them in the interview.

The focus of this app is to provide a way for people to have new experiences and make new friends via outdoor Wellington activities. Our hope is that we have a place for people looking to expand both their friend group and adventurous horizons.

## The Tech

We are going to need the following:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [Knex.js (SQL)](https://knexjs.org/)
* [React-Router](#)

We will create database migrations through knex to create a database. We will use seed files to insert test data into our database.

We will not be making this website responsive to mobile and other devices initially.

## User Stories

### MVP

As a user I should be able to...

* navigate through the pages of the website without issue.
* select my sport/outdoor activity of choice.
* see a list of tracks/locations specific to skill level.
* see a list of meetup posts.
* create a meetup with a skill-level and location, as well as some other junk.
* say if I am going to attend a meetup.

### Stretch

* ...register and login to the website.
* ...and only be able to make new postings if I am a registered user.
* ...I should be able to see anyone who is going to attend a meetup I have created.
* ...only be able to respond to a meetup if I am logged in.
* ...I should have a user page and profile and shows my meetups and a pretty photo of me.
* ...Create a new sport/activity that specifically has to be outside.
* ... Set expiry date on post which would delete it.

## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npx knex migrate:latest
npx knex seed:run
mv .env.example .env
```

To run in development:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run in production:
```sh
npm start
```

### Git - Managing Branches

Pull down dev branch - git pull origin dev

Checkout to feature branch - git checkout feature_branch

git add

git commit -m "commmit message"

git checkout dev

.git pull origin dev

..git checkout feature_branch

...git pull origin dev

fix all conflicts - check localhost still works*

git add

git commit

git push origin feature_branch

create pull request in Github

notify git master



## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
